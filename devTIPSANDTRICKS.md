# Tips and Tricks for Developers

## Debugging

* I wish to see the error message that's related to why my javascript file isn't executing (exceptions, etc)

Firefox:
 1. Go to "Web Developer" > "Toggle Tools" (Ctrl + Shift + I) in the "more options button"/ button with the three horizontal lines.

 2. In the new window that was just created, select the "Console" tab.
